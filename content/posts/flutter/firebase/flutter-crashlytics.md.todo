In this article, I will give overview of the process of publishing Flutter applications on Android and iOS platforms in multiple environments. In real-world applications development process, there are multiple environments and/or stages an applications is released in. During development stage, you may want to share your app to internal testers with a backend configured for development but not ready for production purpose. If you want to distribute your app to internal testers, you need a `dev` variant for the application.

When you are ready to roll-out the application for public release and have production backend ready, you need a variant of same app which is connected to the production backend. Let's call this variant of app as `prod` flavor.

# Pre-requisites

In this article, I will use default `CounterApp` in two variants or flavors: `dev` for development, and `prod` for production. Let's assume this app uses Firebase for backend. The `dev` flavor/variant of app uses one instance of Firebase project, and `prod` flavor uses different instance of Firebase project.
