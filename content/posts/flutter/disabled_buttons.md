This micro article shows how to disable the RaisedButton and FlatButton widgets in Flutter applications.

The `RaisedButton` and/or `FlatButton` widget(s) can be disabled by assigning `onPressed` property to `null`. They can be disabled when `onPressed` property is not used at all. In order to make these widgets clickable, a function needs to be assigned to the `onPressed` property.
