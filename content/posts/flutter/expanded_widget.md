The `Expanded` widget is a single child layout widget which means it can have only one child assigned to it. In this example, the `Row` widget has three children built using `childWidget()`. Each of the child is wrapped in the `Expanded` widget. All children expands themselves in the direction of main-axis, which is horizontal in this case. However, when a value for `flex` property can be provided to resolve any competition for the space. In the second example below, each `Expanded` widget is provided the `flex` value.
