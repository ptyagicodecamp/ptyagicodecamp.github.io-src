The `FittedBox` widget is a single child layout widget which means it can have only one child assigned to it. In this example, the `Row` widget is added as child to `FittedBox` widget. The `Row` widget has two `Image` widgets as its children. Normally, the second child of `Row` widget will overflow to right when it renders its children on a screen size which is not sufficient to accommodate all of its children. However, with `FittedBox` this problem of widget overflowing is solved. It scales and position its child within the parent widget.
