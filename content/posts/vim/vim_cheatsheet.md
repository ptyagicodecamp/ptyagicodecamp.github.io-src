This article is a quick getting started guide to Vim editor commands. Vim editor is an improved version of classic `Vi` editor, hence named 'Vi Improved' or `Vim` in short.

__*Note*__: I'm using macOS Terminal to run vim editor.

## Installing Vim Editor (macOS)

You can download Vim editor on macOS using Homebrew package manager.

```
brew install vim
```

Verify the installation of Vim editor by checking its version as below:

```
vim --version
```

The above command will print the current version of Vim editor as below:

```
% vim --version

```

## Opening Vim editor

You can start opening the editor by using `vim` followed by the file name as below:

```
The above command will open the `test_file` in vim editor. Press `i` to change to insert mode to start writing into file.
