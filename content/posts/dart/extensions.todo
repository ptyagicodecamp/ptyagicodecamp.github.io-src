### What Is An `extension` Method ?

Sometimes you may want to add utility method(s) in a third-party library or in a core class like [String](https://api.dart.dev/stable/2.7.2/dart-core/String-class.html) for your convenience. However, it may not be possible to add your methods in those classes. For example, the `String` class can not be extended or implemented. Attempting to do so yields a compile-time error.

In such scenarios, `extensions` methods come handy. They've been introduced in Dart 2.6 release. In the following section, let's explore few examples to use it.
