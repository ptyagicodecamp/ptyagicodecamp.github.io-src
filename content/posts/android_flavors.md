Summary: This post shows how did I set up flavors for an Android app.

### Understanding differences between "Build Types", "Flavor" and "Build Variant"

***Build Types:
Build Type refers to build and packaging settings like signing configuration for a project.

***Flavor:
A flavor is used to specify custom features, minimum and target API levels, device and API requirements like layout, drawable and custom code (for example, if production code is slightly different than development code).

***Build Variant:
The combination of Build Type and Flavor is known as Build Variant.
